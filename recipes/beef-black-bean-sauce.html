    <h2>A delicious dish commonly found in Chinese Restaurants.</h2>
    <p>
      The dish features thinly sliced beef, marinated to enhance its tenderness
      and flavor, stir-fried with a vibrant mix of colorful vegetables such as
      bell peppers and onions. The star of the dish is the black bean sauce,
      made from fermented black beans, garlic, ginger, and soy sauce, which
      imparts a deep umami taste with a hint of sweetness and a touch of heat.
      This hearty and flavorful dish is often served over steamed rice or
      noodles.
