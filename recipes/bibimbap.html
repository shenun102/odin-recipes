    <h2>A delicious korean dish.</h2>
    <p>
      Bibimbap is a traditional Korean dish that offers a delightful blend of
      flavors and textures. It consists of a bowl of warm white rice topped with
      an array of seasoned vegetables, such as carrots, spinach, bean sprouts,
      and mushrooms. Thinly sliced meat, usually beef, is often added, along
      with a fried egg. The dish is completed with a dollop of gochujang (Korean
      chili paste) for a spicy kick, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds for added
      flavor. Before eating, all the ingredients are mixed together, creating a
      harmonious and vibrant meal that is both nutritious and satisfying.
